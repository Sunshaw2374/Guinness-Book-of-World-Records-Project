    <br>Her tranquil state of mind probably contributed to Jeanne’s long, long life (“That’s why they call me Calment,” she quipped at her 121st birthday in 1996), and may have helped her stave off senility – she remained clear thinking right up to the day she passed away in 1997, aged 122 years 164 days.

Till now we saw various records. Now, let's have a look on a record which has been set up by the nature itself. Yes, we are talikng about the world's tallest waterfall, Angel Falls.<br>
Angel falls, with a majestic height of 979 m(3212 ft), is situated in VENEZUELA (SALTO ANGEL).Its greatest single drop measures 807 m (2,648 ft), with other rapids and cascades combining to form the remaining height.
Angel Falls is named after the American aviator Jimmie Angel. On November 18, 1933, he became the first person to fly over them, thus sharing their existence with the public and forever linking himself to one of Earth’s true natural wonders.
